## 👋 Hi there, I'm Azril

I'm a self-taught developer passionate about backend systems and **Golang**.  
Currently learning to build fast, scalable APIs and cloud-native applications.  
Also exploring a bit of **Rust** out of curiosity for systems-level programming.

### 🔧 Tech I'm Exploring:
- **Language**: Go (main), Rust (light)
- **Tools**: REST API, gRPC, Docker, PostgreSQL
- **Concepts**: Microservices, Clean Architecture, Concurrency

### 🌱 Goals:
- Become a backend engineer by **2030**
- Contribute to open source projects
- Build real-world backend systems

### 📫 Let's connect:
